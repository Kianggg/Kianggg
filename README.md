# Hello! :)

My name is Michael Kiang.
I studied web programming at Harvard and I'm graduating with an MFA in game design from the NYU Game Center in May.
I made [this game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457370/Victoria_Clair_and_the_Mystery_Express/) and [this website for a friend](https://www.ilion.dog/) from scratch.

Check out my [itch.io profile](https://mkiang.itch.io) or [my website](michael.kiang.net) to see more of my games!
